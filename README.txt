Some of Perry Hook's Programming Exercises for 
Machine Learning on Coursera, offered by Stanford.

This code is written in GNU Octave.

If you want quickly find where I have written code, 
you can look at the pdf describing the exercise.  
Near the top is a list of the files.  Ones marked 
with a * are ones where I had to implement 
something.

Note that I have written the code in sections of 
files that say:
%=============== YOUR CODE HERE ================

% My code!

%===============================================

For others that may be taking this class, looking 
at my solutions violates the honor code.  Don't do 
it!
